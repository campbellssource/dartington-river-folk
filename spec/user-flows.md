# Core user flows

This app exists to capture observations about the state of the river.
At different times there will be different studies taking place with users being asked to record different types of observations. To start with we are asking users to observer how surface water flows in times of heavy rain.

## Monitor user flows

- First visit
    - users will have landed on bidwellbrook.org and followed a link here to find out more about making observations 
    - we need to tell them that we need people who can go out when asked and observe water in key areas
    - they will be interested in where we are making observations, and what information we will require. An interactive map should show where observations are needed
    - they will need to register an account so that we can contact them when we need observations and to log in to make observations
    - To record an observation they will be asked questions about an area, upload videos to support their observation
- Register, ready to get notifications, learn how to make an observation
    - We will use email based registration with a magic link email to verify the email address.
    - they can access their account again with a password or magic link
    - they should have to agree to some GDPR compliant Terms and privacy statement
    - Once registered they will be invited to sign up for the mailing list, make an observation or see observations others have made.
    - in their account they can opt out of receiving emails, or opt back in if they had previously opted out
    

- Make an observation
    - users will be sent an email when we need observations making, suggesting when heavy rain is forecast
        - email should contain a link to unsubscribe, from these notifications
    - they will follow a link to a page where they can make an observation, or navigate here themselves
    - they will be asked to select a location from a map or list of locations
    - they will be asked to answer a series of questions about the observation
    - they will be asked to upload photos or videos to support their observation
    - once submitted they will see a confirmation page and be invited to make another observation or see other observations
- see other observations
    - navigate to a specific observation site and see observations made by others, drill into any observation to see more details, although it should be possible to get most of the information from summary views
    - see a list of all observations, with filters for one or more specific sites


## Co-ordinator user flows
- configure interactive map.
    - a co ordinator needs to be able to use an interactive google map (or open street map) to set up locations where observations are needed
    - they need to be able to add, edit and delete locations
    - they need to be able to add details about each location, including a description, and any specific questions to ask about that location
- manage observations
- get notification when new observations are made
- opt in or out of email notifications about new observations
- view observations (this can use the same interface as users seeing observations, but may contain additional control or data)
