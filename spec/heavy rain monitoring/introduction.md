# Heavy rain monitoring

Autumn 2025

A project asking monitors to observe suspected interaction between the informal (agricultural land and natural spaces) and formal drainage systems that would route runoff into the combined sewer system.

Observations around Dartington, Totnes, Devon, UK. post code: TQ9
long/lat: 50.446551, -3.709278

each site below has its own long/lat and drawn area on the map. 

See [BBP Survey Briefing Note])Survey Briefing Note.pdf) and [BBP Survey Plan](Survey Plan.pdf) for more details.

## Text from the briefing note:

The plan includes areas where there are suspected interactions between the informal (agricultural land and natural spaces) and formal drainage systems that would route runoff into the combined sewer system. The yellow points are based on a desktop mapping exercise, whilst the green areas are based on judgement or prior observations. 
The numbered areas on the plan and the question(s) we are looking for evidence to answer are as follows:

1. Is runoff from land to the north flowing onto the highway and into the drainage gullies? 
2. Is runoff from land to the north and routed by the A384 ponding here and entering highway drainage 
gullies? 
3. Watercourse crossing - is there potential for water entering manholes nearby? 
4. Watercourse from north-west assumed to enter culvert beneath road and properties but could spill 
onto highway – any evidence for this? Is runoff from land to north and west being routed by highways 
and accumulating here. 
5. Combined Sewer crosses Bidwell Brook with manholes close to channel – is there any potential for 
water to enter these manholes? 
6. Surface water is known to accumulate here. Does it originate from land/properties to the south? Does 
it flow onto the highway or enter drainage infrastructure in this area? 
7. Does runoff routed by the highway network accumulate here? Is it entering the drainage gullies? Is 
there any obvious connection with the watercourse? 
8. Possible for interaction between stream and nearby manholes? 
9. Does runoff from the south flow on to the road and enter the drainage gullies? 
10. Does runoff accumulate here and enter the drainage gullies? 
11. Does runoff accumulate in this corner of the field before flowing north and onto the highway? 
12. Is runoff being routed by farm track from the north? 
13. Could runoff be entering manholes in this area? 
14. Observed flooding of the road and nearby properties. Where does the runoff originate from - could it be coming from the track to north-east? Where does it drain? 
15. Is runoff being intercepted and routed along Cott Lane? 
16. Is runoff being intercepted and flowing down Cott Road toward the main junction? 
17. Is the highway intercepting runoff from surrounding land and routing it towards Dartington 
Mill/Parsonage Farm 
18. Is the A384 intercepting runoff from surrounding land and routing it towards Dartington School 
roundabout? 
19. Is runoff or ponding in this area of Dartington Mill interacting with drainage infrastructure. 
20. Is runoff from the land to the south-west being intercepted and routed along the highway to this 
junction

## for each site:

Additional observational data is needed to either confirm or dismiss these possible interactions. Things to look for and record could include: 
- Obvious points of entry into the sewers where surface flow paths cross over or near the network. 
- Evidence of runoff from surrounding land (i.e. not the highway) entering the road drainage gullies. 
Ideally, observations would be made during or shortly after periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall, but other 
evidence of flow paths might include: 
- Erosion Patterns: Look for bare soil, gullies, or washouts caused by water movement. 
- Sediment Deposits: Identify areas where silt or debris has accumulated. 
- Water Staining: Note discoloration or staining on surfaces indicating past water flow. 
- Pooling Areas: Identify spots where water tends to pool. 
The types of observations or evidence that would be most useful: 
- Photos + short Videos from a smartphone. 
- Points marked on a map with written notes. 
- Times and dates of observations.
